# quality-gate

Prove a change is good before pushing websites.

1. Run `python3 -m pytest tests/ botsite/tests dashboard/tests review/tests -q (all four service suites); python3 bootstrap.py check --strict (kit gate)` — the project's full verification (tests + lint/types).
2. Run `python3 bootstrap.py check --strict` — doc + session-log hygiene. If
   step 1 already IS this command, do not stop at one gate: run the repo's
   remaining gates named in its boot file instead (fleet-manager lesson
   2026-08-04 — the collision silently dropped the false-wall guard).
3. Report every failure with the exact command to reproduce it.
4. Do NOT push on red — green here should mean green in CI.

Declared capabilities: run.
