# quality-gate

Prove a change is good before pushing websites.

1. Run `python3 -m pytest tests/ -q (app tests); python3 bootstrap.py check --strict (kit gate)` — the project's full verification (tests + lint/types).
2. Run `bootstrap check --strict` — doc + session-log hygiene.
3. Report every failure with the exact command to reproduce it.
4. Do NOT push on red — green here should mean green in CI.

Declared capabilities: run.
