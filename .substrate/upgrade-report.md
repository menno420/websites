## Carve-out scan

- carve-out scan: ran — no kit-owned live workflow installed, nothing to scan.

## Capability-ledger seed refresh

- capability-seed: docs/CAPABILITIES.md carries no kit-owned seed fence and its seed section does not match the old template — hand-adopt once: replace your discovery-rule + Capabilities/Walls seed sections with the fenced block (BEGIN/END markers) from the new template, keeping your append log below it; afterwards upgrades refresh the fence automatically.

This upgrade ships the venue-scoped capability ledger (grounded-skills §4.2): entries carry a venue token (owner-live · autonomous-project · routine-fired · subagent · any) and the ledger's kit-owned seed block carries the posture decision rule. If this repo carries a local prose copy of the boot-triad/venue-posture rule (superbot Q-0270), that copy is now superseded by docs/CAPABILITIES.md's posture rule — collapse the local copy into a pointer.

    a guessed wall and a verified wall are different facts.
 4. **Append the finding same session** — capability or wall, dated, with the

 never exit-affecting — when a non-`none` ⚑ needs-owner list lacks these fields.
 
 Grammar source of truth: the tokens, field lists, and regexes of this format are kit-owned constants in the kit's `src/engine/grammar.py` (EAP §6.8) — the SAME module the `check` enforcers consume, so writer and enforcer cannot drift; agreement is pinned by the kit's `tests/test_grammar.py`.
+
+## Owner-assist output standard — every owner-facing output, not just asks
+
+The OWNER-ACTION block above covers the *needs-owner ask*; this standard
+covers ALL output routed to the owner — reports, questions, values to paste,
+links. The contract in one line: **the owner never derives anything** — an
+output that requires the owner to parse, derive, or transform anything is a
+drafting defect, not an owner task.
+
+1. **Paste-ready, finished values.** Every value the owner must enter is
+   computed and printed final — `NAME=value`, the full command, the full
+   file body — never a recipe for deriving it. When the owner must paste
+   something, give the exact link to where it goes; a full file goes in ONE
+   copyable fenced block, directly in chat.
+2. **Exact destination, always.** Every action names its exact destination:
+   a deep URL, a console path to the exact field (surface → section →
+   field, e.g. `Railway → project → service → Variables`), or a repo path +
+   line. Never a bare "go to settings" — `check` nags that class (advisory).
+3. **Risk class on every manual step:** ✅ safe / read-only · ↩️ reversible
+   (say how to undo) · ⚠️ irreversible / destructive. One class per step,
+   stated on the step (the `RISK:` line in an OWNER-ACTION block).
+4. **Structured choices, recommendation first.** A decision put to the
+   owner is options A/B(/C) with a **bolded recommendation** and a one-line
+   rationale, answerable with one letter — never an ask that requires the
+   owner to parse, derive, or transform anything.
+5. **Large outputs: digest + rendered link, never a wall of text.** Default
+   delivery is a control-plane rendered link plus a 3-line digest in chat;
+   the fallback — full text in one copyable block directly in chat — applies
+   where the control plane cannot render the repo yet. Link rules: deep-link
+   the exact file, never the repo root; the rendered view for things the
+   owner should *read*, the GitHub blob URL for things the owner should
+   *edit*; post-merge, link `ref=main`; the control-plane render cache is
+   180 s — append `&refresh=1` when the owner must see a just-pushed change.
+
+Worked example — digest + rendered deep link + a six-field ask carrying its
+risk class (every rule above in one output):
