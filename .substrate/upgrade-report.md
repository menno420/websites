## Carve-out scan

- carve-out scan: .github/workflows/auto-merge-enabler.yml — ran, 0 found

## Capability-ledger seed refresh

- capability-seed: NOT refreshed — the fenced seed block in docs/CAPABILITIES.md differs from the kit-form fence (edited inside the fence, or the old templates are unavailable). The fence is kit-owned: move your own findings BELOW the fence into the append log, restore the block between the BEGIN/END markers to kit form (copy it from the new template render), and the next upgrade refreshes it automatically.

This upgrade ships the venue-scoped capability ledger (grounded-skills §4.2): entries carry a venue token (owner-live · autonomous-project · routine-fired · subagent · any) and the ledger's kit-owned seed block carries the posture decision rule. If this repo carries a local prose copy of the boot-triad/venue-posture rule (superbot Q-0270), that copy is now superseded by docs/CAPABILITIES.md's posture rule — collapse the local copy into a pointer.

## Seat-digest refresh

- seat-digest: NOT regenerated — docs/seat-digest.md differs from the last kit-written render (hand-edited, or no hash recorded). It is a derived render, never a copy of record: move any real finding into the capability ledger / skill index, then regenerate with `python3 bootstrap.py seat-digest` (overwrites this file only; the sources are untouched).
