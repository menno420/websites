## Carve-out scan

- carve-out scan: .github/workflows/auto-merge-enabler.yml — ran, 0 found

## Capability-ledger seed refresh

- capability-seed: NOT refreshed — the fenced seed block in docs/CAPABILITIES.md differs from the kit-form fence (edited inside the fence, or the old templates are unavailable). The fence is kit-owned: move your own findings BELOW the fence into the append log, restore the block between the BEGIN/END markers to kit form (copy it from the new template render), and the next upgrade refreshes it automatically.

This upgrade ships the venue-scoped capability ledger (grounded-skills §4.2): entries carry a venue token (owner-live · autonomous-project · routine-fired · subagent · any) and the ledger's kit-owned seed block carries the posture decision rule. If this repo carries a local prose copy of the boot-triad/venue-posture rule (superbot Q-0270), that copy is now superseded by docs/CAPABILITIES.md's posture rule — collapse the local copy into a pointer.

## Seat-digest refresh

- seat-digest: regenerated docs/seat-digest.md (derived render — skills index + venue-filtered walls re-rendered from the current tree; venue filter preserved from the committed doc).

## Applied (--apply-docs)

- applied: docs/SKILLS.md (template@new, hash re-recorded)

   `bootstrap adopt --lane <name>`: it plants `control/status-<name>.md` (skip-if-exists),

+## Delegated tally — coordinator-written heartbeats (multi-repo seats)
+
+A coordinator seat that spans several repos may legitimately write the authoritative
+tally in ITS status file, leaving the member repos' own heartbeats stale **by design**
+(live precedent: the 2026-07-12→13 night run — the mineverse coordinator wrote the whole
+SuperBot World tally while the member seats' heartbeats sat hours stale, and a
+staleness-only sweep would have misclassified shipping seats as stalled). Two conventions
+keep the delegation legible instead of looking like a dead lane:
+
+1. **The delegated write is MARKED.** A coordinator overwriting a member repo's status
+   (or carrying its tally) states so on the heartbeat it writes, first line after
+   `updated:`:
+
+   ```markdown
+   COORDINATOR-DELEGATED heartbeat write — the coordinator seat authorized this status
+   overwrite; authoritative tally for this repo lives here.
+   ```
+
+   One-writer-per-file is preserved as *one writer at a time*: the delegation line names
+   the current writer, so a sweep never sees two silent writers.
+
+2. **The member repo POINTS to its live tally.** A seat whose tally is delegated keeps
+   its own `status.md` from going silently stale by carrying a standing pointer in
+   `notes:` (or directly under `updated:`):
+
+   ```markdown
+   notes: tally DELEGATED to the coordinator seat — live status lives in
+   <coordinator-repo> control/status.md; this heartbeat updates only on this seat's own
+   sessions.
+   ```
+
+**Sweep rule (for managers and roll-up readers):** classify a seat by its **PR record +
+the coordinator's status file**, never by seat-heartbeat staleness alone. A stale member
+heartbeat carrying the delegation pointer is a healthy delegated lane; a stale heartbeat
+with no pointer and no PR activity is the actual dark-lane signal.
